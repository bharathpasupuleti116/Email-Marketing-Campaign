# 📧 Email Marketing Campaign - Prediction and Analysis

## 🔍 Project Overview
The project revolves around analyzing the performance of an email marketing campaign and optimizing it based on data-driven observations and machine learning. The goal is to enhance **click-through rates (CTR)** based on user behavior, audience segmentation, and prediction of engagement results.

## 📁 Notebook Contents
The Jupyter Notebook (`EmailMarketingCampaign.ipynb`) contains:

- **Data Loading and Exploration**
  - Three main datasets:
    - `email_table`: Stores data about emails sent.
    - `email_opened_table`: Tracks which emails have been opened.
    - `link_clicked_table`: Stores which emails led to link clicks.
  - Fundamental exploratory data analysis (EDA).

- **Feature Engineering**
  - Data merging to form a single table.
  - Feature generation for user segmentation and behavior study.

- **Data Visualization**
  - Graphical analysis of user interaction patterns.

- **Machine Learning Models**
  - Developed and tested various classification models:
    - **Logistic Regression**
    - **Random Forest Classifier**
    - **XGBoost Classifier**
  - Compared the performances of the models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Chose the top-performing model for click-through prediction.

- **Insights and Recommendations**
  - Identified trends in users' behavior.
  - Offered actionable tips for enhancing email marketing success.
