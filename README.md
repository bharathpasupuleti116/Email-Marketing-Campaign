# 📧 Email Marketing Campaign - Analysis and Prediction

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of an email marketing campaign and optimizing it using data-driven insights and machine learning. The objective is to improve **click-through rates (CTR)** by understanding user behavior, segmenting audiences, and predicting engagement outcomes.

## 📁 Notebook Contents
The Jupyter Notebook (`EmailMarketingCampaign.ipynb`) includes:

- **Data Loading and Exploration**
  - Three primary datasets:
    - `email_table`: Contains information about sent emails.
    - `email_opened_table`: Records which emails were opened.
    - `link_clicked_table`: Tracks which emails resulted in link clicks.
  - Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).

- **Feature Engineering**
  - Merging datasets to create a unified table.
  - Creating new features for user segmentation and behavior analysis.

- **Data Visualization**
  - Graphical analysis of user engagement patterns.

- **Machine Learning Models**
  - Built and evaluated multiple classification models:
    - **Logistic Regression**
    - **Random Forest Classifier**
    - **XGBoost Classifier**
  - Compared model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Selected the best-performing model for predicting click-through behavior.

- **Insights and Recommendations**
  - Discovered patterns in user behavior.
  - Provided actionable strategies to improve email marketing effectiveness.
